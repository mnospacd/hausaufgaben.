# hausaufgaben.

>In English: "homework."

I created this app only for my class, because no teacher is properly using our online school platform **"Lanis"**  _(like writing fucking homework in this stupid platform)_. There are some teachers which are using the platform properly, but most not. There are also other reasons, many forget their passwords and the platform is just crab shit, but there is an app which is better for using the platform ([check here](https://github.com/Baumlaeufer0815/sph-planner)), but this app has its own problems.

Since I made this app only for my class, the code is no the best, I am also a beginner in Flutter.

## The app

For the homework I use Firebase to store the data online. For the substitutes I will use a web scraper in flutter or by an extra API. The timetable will be hardcoded.

## Wie man es installiert

>"Instructions", this will be german only.
